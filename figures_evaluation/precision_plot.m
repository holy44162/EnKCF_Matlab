%PRECISION_PLOT
%   Calculates precision for a series of distance thresholds (percentage of
%   frames where the distance to the ground truth is within the threshold).
%   The results are shown in a new figure if SHOW is true.
%
%   Accepts positions and ground truth as Nx2 matrices (for N frames), and
%   a title string.
